# focus-stack
Web app that turns video into a focus stacked image.

Uses a node backend to download a video from youtube and process it using native libraries (ffmpeg and enfuse) to produce a focus-stacked image.

# e.g.

(Warning: closeup of a bee's face; don't be squeemish)

Turns this:
[![kinda disturbing video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5zOIg4e48U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5zOIg4e48U)

Into this:
